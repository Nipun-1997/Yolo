# Yolo
Here I have used Yolo V5s on Racoon Dataset taken from RoboFlow. Here our class is only 1 which is racoon thats why our classification loss->0
Used pytorch for implementing the yolov5 and checked the inference
Main purpose of this Notebook is to know what are the commands has to be used for custom dataset if object detection need to be done using Yolo V5.
