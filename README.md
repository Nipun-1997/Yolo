# Yolo
Here I have used Yolo V5s on Racoon Dataset taken from RoboFlow. Here our class is only 1 which is racoon thats why our classification loss->0<br>
Used pytorch for implementing the yolov5 and checked the inference<br>
Main purpose of this Notebook is to know what are the commands has to be used for custom dataset if object detection need to be done using Yolo V5. <br>
